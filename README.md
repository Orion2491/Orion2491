# Hi! I'm Ben.
I'm currently in university studying Cyber Security & Digital Forensics. One of the modules on this course is Python. As the semester has progressed I have better understood GitHub, learnt the basics of python, completed weekly notebook tasks, and completed a project. I came into the module with very little knowledge of Python so, while I am still far from knowledgable in it, I have gathered a much better understanding of how to program, syntax, and general programming knowledge.
